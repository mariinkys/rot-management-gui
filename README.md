## Notes

Key features are:

- Update your System
- Update your Flatpak applications
- Rollback your system in case anything goes wrong
- Pin and Unpin Images, view all your images...

This project is being developed to help people who are not that experienced with Linux and the CLI manage their atomic systems. I know that Gnome Software has "full" integration with RPM OSTree; however, in my personal experience, Gnome Software is not that reliable nor fast on Fedora Silverblue (also, there are some missing options...), hence why I considered developing this tool. This software is not and will never be a full replacement for Gnome Software. I just want people to be able to interact with RPM OSTree and keep both their system and packages updated...

Special thanks to Simon and Catalina for their patience and confidence to switch their work machines from Windows to Fedora Silverblue and for the idea and motivation for this project.
